MOTIVATION~

A manifest-based ML system, which can be eye ball checked and diffed in plain
text format. The manifest can be filled with default values for required
properties and checksum will be generated to highlight the diff (think merkle
tree).

Weight initialization, training, and inference are different components
operated on the same manifest--data driven not object driven.

Random seeds are tree splitting sematics.

ROADMAP~

Build weight initialization and inference step.
